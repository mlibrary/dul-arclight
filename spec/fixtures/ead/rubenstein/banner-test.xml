        Distinguished Professor of Art at Stockton University in New Jersey. This photograph
        collection comprises two bodies of work by White that explore aspects of African American
        history through artifacts, archives, and 21st century landscapes. The first, "Manifest,"
        comprises 45 24x30 inch color inkjet photographs of single objects relating to African
        American material culture and history, taken by White in various public and private
        collections throughout the U.S. Subjects in these stark images include a diary, printed
        notices, slavery narratives, a lock of Frederick Douglass's hair, a drum, a slave collar, a
        tobacco pouch, a tintype photograph, and other objects. "Manifest" is the 2015 winner of the
        Archive of Documentary Arts Collection Award for Documentarians of Color. The second
        portfolio, "Red Summer," refers to race-related violence against African Americans that took
        place from 1912 to 1923, with the majority occurring during the summer of 1919. It consists
        of 30 24x42 inch color photographs, taken by White from 2017 to 2018, at sites across the
        United States where violence against African Americans - assaults, riots, and lynchings -
        took place, paired with contemporaneous newspaper accounts of the events. Acquired as part
        of the Archive of Documentary Arts at Duke University.</abstract>

      <head>Collection Overview</head>
      <p>The Wendel White photographs collection consists of two bodies of work that explore aspects
        of African American history through images of artifacts, historical printed pieces and
        manuscripts, and 21st century landscapes. </p>
      <p>The first, "Manifest," comprises 45 24x30 inch color inkjet photographs of single objects
        relating to African American material culture and history, taken by White in various public
        and private collections throughout the U.S. Subjects in these stark images include a diary,
        printed notices, slavery narratives, a lock of Frederick Douglass's hair, a drum, a slave
        collar, a tobacco pouch, a tintype photograph, and other objects. "Manifest" is the 2015
        winner of the Archive of Documentary Arts Collection Award for Documentarians of Color. </p>
      <p>The second portfolio, "Red Summer," refers to race-related violence against African
        Americans that took place from 1912 to 1923, with the majority occurring during the summer
        of 1919. It consists of 30 24x42 inch color photographs, taken from 2017 to 2018, of the
        sites across the United States where violence against African Americans - assaults, riots,
        lynchings - took place, paired with contemporaneous newspaper accounts of the events. </p>
      <p>The photographer notes: "Several projects that have occupied my attention during the past
        two decades are, in retrospect, part of a broader effort to seek out the ghosts that
        continue to haunt the remnants of the past." The full artist's statements on "Manifest" and
        "Red Summer" are included in the series descriptions for those projects.</p>
      <p>A photobook based on the "Manifest" project was published in 2014 by Chroma (California
        Institute of Integral Studies) as <title render="italic">Manifest</title>. Images from both
        projects have been exhibited in institutions across the U.S.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents</head>
          <p>The 45 photographic prints in this series are from Wendel White's project titled
            "Manifest," initiated in 2009 and continuing into 2019. White included the following
            abstract about his work:</p>
          <p>"The Manifest portfolio images are photo-based representations of objects, documents,
            photographs, and books made in various public and private collections throughout the
            U.S. These repositories encompass elements of material culture such as diaries, slave
            collars, human hair, a drum, souvenirs, and other objects, some with great significance
            and others simply quotidian representations of daily life, from the history of the
            African American community.</p>
          <p>This project (Manifest) is an effort to seek out the cultural artifacts of the American
            concept and representation of race. The histories of slavery, abolition, segregation,
            the U.S. Civil War, and the Civil Rights Era are a few of the narratives that emerge in
            these photographs.</p>
          <p>I am increasingly interested in the residual power of the past to inhabit these
            material remains. The ability of objects to transcend lives, centuries, and millennia,
            suggests a remarkable mechanism for folding time, bringing the past and the present into
            a shared space that is uniquely suited to artistic exploration. While the artifacts are
            remarkable as visual evidence of lives and events, I also intend the viewer to consider
            this informal reliquary as a survey of the impulse and motivation to preserve history
            and memory.</p>
          <p>Several projects that have occupied my attention during the past two decades are, in
            retrospect, part of a broader effort to seek out the ghosts that continue to haunt the
            remnants of the past. I am drawn to the stories that dwell within these objects."</p>
          <p>"Manifest" received the 2015 Archive of Documentary Arts Award for Documentarians of
            Color. A recent book based on this work was published by Chroma (California Institute of
            Integral Studies) as <title render="italic">Manifest</title> and is available through
            the Chroma website.</p>
